Welcome to the game! You have a total of 30 turns to escape. Each command you type counts as a turn, and I am only capable of understanding two-word commands, so choose your words wisely. Type help for a total list of commands at any time during the game.

You find yourself in a large foyer. There is a door to the north. To the west is a bench against the wall. To the east is a chest on the floor. In the center of the room is a large candle. The candle is unlit.
** You have 30 turns remaining.

Enter command: >> help

Here is a list of commands you can use: 

Word 1: open | close | light | read | write | play | look | get | go
Word 2: door | room | bench | chest | candle | note | matches | shelves | book | pen | scroll | music | trumpet | piano | drum | lock | north | south | east | west
